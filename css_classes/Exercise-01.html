<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>

<p>If you could visit anywhere in the world, where would it be?</p>
<p> I want to visit Santorini, Greece because of the immense history and culture that resides there. I also think that the city has a unique characteristic and beautiful landscape.
I am excited to hopefully (in the future) visit there sometime.</p>

<h2>A person I admire (past or present).</h2>

<p> Someone I admire is Lady Gaga. Throughout her career she has supported the LGBTQ+ community and allowed people in the community to feel
    unapologetic for who they are and who they choose to be. I think that she has definitely helped me become a more confident person through her music,
artistic choices and influences over me and others in my generation.</p>

<!--This is my last list.-->
